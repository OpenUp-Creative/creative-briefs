As part of the Open Up project, we'd like to organize a community around developing Creative Commons (and/or GPL) licensed Narrative scripting tools for games and other story-telling media. (For example, documentation and other widgets for [Inform](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/), an open source programming language for interactive fiction.)

These scripts will be used for the Open Up game project, but should also be open source licensed projects in their own right. 

There are two new features of Inform we plan to explore:

- [**Multiple Source Files**](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0003-multiple-source-files.md) - Create prototypes of multi-author projects like [The Quad Game](https://el3.judithpintar.com/collaborations/if-course-projects/) and [Cragne Manor](https://rcveeder.net/cragne/) that make life easier for Judith Pintar, Jenni Polodna, and anyone else interested in herding cats.
- [**Dialogue Trees**](https://github.com/ganelson/inform-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0009-dialogue-sections.md) - Create a set of background dialogue for characters in a fantasy/medieval marketplace, to support the Stack Kingdom Open Up Game. ([More information here](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/creative/discussions) and some [visual references here](https://github.com/orgs/OpenUp-Creative/teams/art-team/discussions/1))

TODOs:
- [ ] Expand on the [Storylet Process](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/creative/discussions/18) for sketching minimal dialogue trees.
- [ ] Develop contributor guide for prospective team members (See e.g. [Job Functions in Game Narrative](https://wildwinter.medium.com/role-functions-in-game-narrative-9d4b4daace3b))
- [ ] Improvements like building [Inform source in Stack Kingdom CI/CD](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/creative/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml)
- [ ] Include Demo of [Map Building and Debugging](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/creative/commit/deac6f47d2cc12aa9cf96a9db9c7f9fd8262229a)
- [ ] Schedule monthly [WIP Reading & Writing workshop](https://intfiction.org/t/wip-reading-and-writing-group-s/57211).
